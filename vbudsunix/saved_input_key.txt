%%% Actinide_Region: 1 = central, 2 = annular.  
Annular not yet supported in GUI version.
%%% Unit_Cell_Geometry: 1 = cylindrical, 2 = rectangular, 3 = spherical. 
only 1 = cylindrical is active in this version.  2 & 3 are supported in the C code,
but they are not well tested yet and are not implemented in the graphical version.
%%% Fuel_Form: 1 = oxide, 2 = carbide, 3 = oxycarbide, 4 = nitride, 5 = metallic unbound
%%% Shim_Region: 0 = none, 1 = central, 2 = annular.
Shim material is elemental boron.
%%% Shim_Concentration [ppm]
%%% Control_Absorber: 1 = none,  2 = B4C, 3 = AgInCd, 4 = Gd2O3
The graphical version doesn't yet burn poisons or adjust control absorber concentrations
during a burnup cycle.  This feature will be added soon.
%%% Fuel_Density   [g/cc]
%%% Fuel_VolFract  [%]
Usage: fuel at density 10 g/cc and 50% volfract is equivalent to fuel at density 
5 g/cc and 100% volfract.  Material is spread homogenously throughout the volume.
Volume fractions in each region do not have to sum to 100%.
%%% Cent_Region_Mat: 1 = none, 2 = H2O, 3 = D2O, 4 = graphite, 5 = He, 6 = CO2,
7 = Pb, 8 = Bi, 9 = Zr, 10 = ZrO2, 11 = ZrH
%%% Cent_Region_Dens [g/cc]
%%% Cent_Region_VF   [%]
Repeat 4 times for Cent_Region and 4 times for Annular_Region.
Same rules for density and volume fraction as above apply.
The ZrH thermal scattering kernel is broken at the moment, need to re-run NJOY.
Several more materials will be added soon.
%%% Specify_Actinides: 1 = relative mass [-], 2 = number density [a/b-cm]
if (1), V:BUDS will compute actinide number densities based upon the Fuel_Density
and Fuel_VolFract specified earlier.  Relative mass fractions don't have to be 
normalized to anything in particular.
if (2), the user-specified values for actinide number densities will be used by V:BUDS.
This OVERRIDES the actinide number density specified by Fuel_Density and Fuel_VolFract.
Fuel_Density and Fuel_VolFract will only be used to calculate the number density of 
nonactinide components of the fuel compound, e.g., oxygen in (Actinide)O2 fuel.
%%% Th-230 through Cm-246: actinide number densities / mass fractions
%%% Clad_Material: 1 = void, 2 = Zr
Nb should be added soon.
%%% Clad_Density [g/cc]
%%% Structural_Material: 1 = void, 2 = Fe
%%% Structural_Density [g/cc]
%%% Structural_VolFract [% of active core]
Structural material is uniformly admixed in all regions; acts as a poison.
%%% CentReg_Temp  [K]
%%% AnnularReg_Temp [K]
must lie between 300 - 1500 K. (300 - 1000 K for compounds with a S(a,b) thermal
scattering kernel, e.g. H2O, D2O, ZrH, graphite).
%%% Core_Radius [cm]
%%% Core_Height [cm] 
Used for leakage calculations.
%%% CentReg_Radius     [cm]
%%% Clad_Thickness     [cm]
%%% Cell_Pitch         [cm]
%%%%%%%%%%%% PLOT / BURNUP GUI OPTIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Plot_TimeDependent:    1 = static, 2 = time dependent / burnup calculation
%%% Plot_Cutoff            [%]
%%% Plot_Burnup            [MWd/kg]
Discharge burnup.  Burnup rate / local power density is assumed constant, so
the burnup per cycle is Plot_Burnup/Plot_NCycles [MWd/kg].
%%% Plot_CycleEFPD         [d]
Reactor uptime per cycle.
%%% Plot_NCycles           
Number of cycles the fuel spends in the reactor before being discharged.
%%% Plot_LoadFactor         90.
Percentage of time during which the reactor is up and fuel is being irradiated.
Downtime is treated as a block of time at the end of each cycle, to simulate refueling.
